## Example

<strong>This text is important!</strong>
```

# HTML `<i>` Elements
The HTML `<i>` element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic. <br>

**Tip: The `<i>` tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, etc.**

## Example

```

# HTML `<em>` Elements
The HTML `<em>` element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic. <br>

**Tip: A screen reader will pronounce the words in `<em>` with an emphasis, using verbal stress.**

```

# HTML `<small>` Element
The HTML `<small>` element defines smaller text.

## Example
```
<small>This is some smaller text.</small>
```

# HTML `<sub>` Element
The HTML `<sub>` element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O:

## Example
```
<p>H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
```

# HTML `<sup>` Element
The HTML `<sup>` element defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Superscript text can be used for footnotes, like a2b:

## Example

```

# HTML `<del>` Element
The HTML `<del>` element defines text that has been deleted from a document. Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text.

## Example
```
<p>My favorite color is <del>red</del> blue.</p>
```

# HTML `<ins>` Element
The HTML `<ins>` element defines a text that has been inserted into a document. Browsers will usually underline inserted text.

## Example
```
<p>My favorite color is <del>red</del> <ins>blue</ins>.</p>
```


# HTML `<mark>` Element
The HTML `<mark>` element defines text that should be marked or highlighted:

## Example
```
<p>Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p>
```
